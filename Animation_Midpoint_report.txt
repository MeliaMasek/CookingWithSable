My progress so far is on track for finishing the project by next friday. I have my kitchen scene fully textured and laid out along with the start of animation. I currently have a few issues with my rig to be fixed with how far the arms can extend and the weight painting on the fingers needs to be adjusted as well. I am hoping to get these done by monday so that I can reload my reference in and have everything rendered by wednedsay.
